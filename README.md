## Overview of the Project

### Project: Simple Calculator
![Task1_SS](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c47b24c1-7440-4047-98a9-978c8e8971cb)




### Objectives of the Project
The objective of this project is to create a basic command-line calculator in Java that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
by ensuring error handling for division by zero and invalid operations, and also to demonstrate the use of multithreading by running each calculation in a separate thread.

### Key Activities in this Project
- **User Input Handling**: Prompts the user to enter two numbers and choose an operation.
- **Multithreaded Calculation**: Creates a new thread for each calculation using the CalculationThread class, which extends Thread.
- **Operation Execution**: Uses the Calculator class to store numbers and perform calculations based on the chosen operation.
- **Error Handling**: Manages exceptions for invalid operations and division by zero.
- **Looped User Interaction**: Allows users to perform multiple calculations until they decide to exit the program.

### Technologies Used
- **Java**: The core language used to develop the calculator, manage threads, and handle user input/output.
- **Java Multithreading (Thread Class)**: To run calculations concurrently, demonstrating basic concurrency in Java.
- **Exception Handling**: For handling errors such as division by zero and invalid operations.
